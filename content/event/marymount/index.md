## Urban Planning Camp

Plan and build a collection of small structures of a city and write a story for the citizens that live within.

When designing a city campers will think about the different scenarios such as geographic location, conservation, nature preservation, or prevention against natural disasters. This city can be make believe reimagined as a different world or designed in a familiar yet undiscovered environment like the Moonâ€™s surface.
