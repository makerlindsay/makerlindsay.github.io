â€‹The Make-HER cohort is a dedicated group of female role models at the Sunnyvale Public Library for a fun, drop-in event to engage youth and families, especially daughters ages 8-12 and mothers to creatively express themselves with activities as an intersection of science, math, technology, engineering and art.
